# Haltech-MK60E5-Bridge
Based off Mintonperformance CAN Triple repository.

Used with a CAN Triple to bridge a BMW MK60E1 or MK60E5 to a Haltech ECU, along with feeding some extra data to an AIM datalogger on the same network as the Haltech.

Anything interesting will (currently) be in `CAN_Triple/src/user_code.c`
